%=================================================================================

% This template implements Latexpand+Latexdiff to compare two projects (either with an arbitrary number of subfiles/subfolders, or just two). All required packages are already included in Overleaf+TeXLive.

%=================================================================================

% INTEDED USE: 
% Put your original project in the "Old" & "New" folders and modify the contents of the former as desired (Or put a modified version of the Old project in the New folder -if you have one- and recompile). All changes will be highlighted in the final pdf.

% SETUP: 
% Please follow the instructions given in the attached readme file.

% FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS:
% To avoid errors: do not delete this main file or the attached latexmkrc file.
% To recompile: always choose this main.tex file before clicking on "Recompile".
% To download outputs: go to LogsAndOutputFiles>OtherLogsAndFiles (next to the "recompile" button). diff.tex will be the highlighted documment, old.tex & new.tex will be the latexpanded versions of Old/main.tex & New/main.tex.
